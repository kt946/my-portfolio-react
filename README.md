# My Portfolio - React
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description

For this project, I built a brand new portfolio using my knowledge of React, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. This portfolio uses the latest technologies that display information about my projects, contact information, and experiences in a single-page application featuring a mobile-first design. This project is the culmination of all the knowledge and skills I have acquired during my bootcamp, which sets my portfolio apart from other developers whose portfolios donâ€™t use the latest technologies. Employers are able to read a short bio about myself in the About Me section, view my projects in the Portfolio section, send a message through a form in the Contact section, and view my resume and skills in the Resume section.
